<h1>eTcl for Windows Mobile 2003</h1>

<h2>WHAT IS IT</h2>

Tcl/Tk 8.4.12 for Windows Mobile 2003 ARM binaries available<br/>
<br/>
This is first public release of our Tcl/Tk port to Windows Mobile 2003 ARM
devices. Binaries, support and updates can be found at <a href="http://www.evolane.com/">http://www.evolane.com/</a><br/>
<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
Just copy executable wherever you want on your device (memory or storage
card), and launch it.
<ul>
<li>Unobstrusive executable. No registry to set, no external
dependencies.</li>
<li>Standalone executable. Tcl and Tk scripts packed into executable (using
VFS). Optimized startup time.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
New Tcl user experience on PocketPC
<ul>
<li>Optimized for XScale devices</li>
<li>Faster Arc/Chord/Pie emulation, improved for ARM architecture without FPU</li>
<li>Efficient WSAAsyncSelect() emulation. Sockets, and fileevents on sockets, should be fully functionnal (in both client and server modes)</li>
<li>Support for native menu</li>
<li>Improved native look and feel. </li>
<li>Windows Mobile specific extension: manage SIP, change (X) button action (closing vs. minimizing),...</li>
<li>Correct handling of mouse (actually touchscreen) events</li>
<li>Support for intercepting hotkeys (calendar, notes, etc...)</li>

<li>New porting approach, based on very minor changes to generic Win32 port (and no changes to generic part of Tcl/Tk distrib).</li>
<li>Patch to Tcl or Tk distribution is only few kilobytes large, everything else has been moved into a minimal emulation library. This should allow us to keep synced with future Tcl/Tk release.</li>
<li>Easy build process. Nothing but Evc4 and a native Tcl interpreter required to build binaries for all target architectures supported by Evc (Cygwin, external libraries, etc... not required)</li>
<li>Works fine into Microsoft Pocket PC 2003 Emulator. Debugging code made easier</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Included native extensions:
<ul>
<li>Pixane: script your image transformation, support for reading and writing several popular image formats (PNG, JPEG), support for TrueType fonts</li>
<li>Sqlite 3: a self-contained, embeddable, zero-configuration SQL database engine</li>
<li>Zlib: native deflate/inflate support</li>
<li>Zipfs: easily Mount your ZIP files into Tcl Virtual Filesystem</li>
</ul>

Included Pure Tcl extensions:
<ul>
<li>EvoTcl: A very large set of tcl utilities (OOP, Database, HTML/XML parsing, ...). See http://www.evolane.com/software/evotcl/</li>
</ul>

Source should be made available soon. In the meantime, others will hopefully
find these binaries useful.<br/>
